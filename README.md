Project Name : News Agrregator

DESCRIPTION : Completed filtering and searching functionality as per requirement. When I search for anything then filter functionality will stop and vice versa when i apply filter functionality. Lazy loading is used when searched or filtered data so be patient while noticing UI. Web app is fully responsive for any device.

NOTE : In filtering and searching there is no relation, not to expect the search result to be filter on top of it(Both the functionalities are created differently).

Technology used : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js, Redux, Docker, axios and various necessary things in react.js

STEPS to use docker (Note It is not working in my device but it is working in other devices.) :
# Build the Docker Image:
# docker build -t news-aggregator .             

# Run the Docker Image:
# docker run -p 3000:3000 news-aggregator
